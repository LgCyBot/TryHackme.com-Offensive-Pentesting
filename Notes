NMAP


nmap -sV <machines ip>
nmap is an free, open-source and powerful tool used to discover hosts and services on a computer network. In our example, we are using nmap to scan this machine to identify all services that are running on a particular port. nmap has many capabilities, below is a table summarising some of the functionality it provides.

Basic Scanning Techniques
• Scan a single target nmap [target]
• Scan multiple targets nmap [target1,target2,etc]
• Scan a list of targets nmap -iL [list.txt]
• Scan a range of hosts nmap [range of IP addresses]
• Scan an entire subnet nmap [IP address/cdir]
• Scan random hosts nmap -iR [number]
• Excluding targets from a scan nmap [targets] –exclude [targets]
• Excluding targets using a list nmap [targets] –excludefile [list.txt]
• Perform an aggressive scan nmap -A [target]
• Scan an IPv6 target nmap -6 [target]

Discovery Options
• Perform a ping scan only nmap -sP [target]
• Don’t ping nmap -PN [target]
• TCP SYN Ping nmap -PS [target]
• TCP ACK ping nmap -PA [target]
• UDP ping nmap -PU [target]
• SCTP Init Ping nmap -PY [target]
• ICMP echo ping nmap -PE [target]
• ICMP Timestamp ping nmap -PP [target]
• ICMP address mask ping nmap -PM [target]
• IP protocol ping nmap -PO [target]
• ARP ping nmap -PR [target]
• Traceroute nmap –traceroute [target]
• Force reverse DNS resolution nmap -R [target]
• Disable reverse DNS resolution nmap -n [target]
• Alternative DNS lookup nmap –system-dns [target]
• Manually specify DNS servers nmap –dns-servers [servers] [target]
• Create a host list nmap -sL [targets]

Version Detection
• Operating system detection nmap -O [target]
• Attempt to guess an unknown nmap -O –osscan-guess [target]
• Service version detection nmap -sV [target]
• Troubleshooting version scans nmap -sV –version-trace [target]
• Perform a RPC scan nmap -sR [target]
